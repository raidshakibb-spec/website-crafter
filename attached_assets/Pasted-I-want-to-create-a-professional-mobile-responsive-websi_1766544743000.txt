I want to create a professional, mobile-responsive website to showcase my products to customers.

Core Functionality

When users open the website, products should be displayed immediately on the homepage.

Products can be organized into categories and support search.

Each product must have its own page or section that includes:

A video or images

A list of product features displayed under the media

Languages & Translation

The website must support Arabic and English.

I will add products and their features only in Arabic from the admin panel.

When users switch the language to English, the website should automatically translate all product content using direct/automatic translation.

Save the user’s language preference and auto-detect language on first visit.

Banners

Reserve visible areas on the website for promotional banners.

From the admin panel, I should be able to:

Upload banner images

Assign a clickable link to each banner

Clicking a banner should redirect users to the assigned link.

Left Sidebar (Vertical Section)

Create a vertical section on the left side of the website that includes:

Payment methods with images (uploadable from admin panel)

Telegram channels with images (uploadable from admin panel)

At the bottom of the Telegram section:

Add a Telegram icon

I will set my Telegram username in the admin panel

Clicking the icon should open my Telegram account directly

Admin Panel (No Coding Required)

The admin panel must allow me to:

Add, edit, and delete products

Upload product videos and images

Add product features (in Arabic only)

Upload banners and set their links

Manage product categories

Upload payment method images

Upload Telegram channel images

Set my Telegram username

Manage all website content easily

Admin panel must be:

Secure (login with email and password)

Mobile-friendly

SEO, Performance & Analytics

SEO-friendly pages (titles, meta descriptions).

Product links should display image, title, and description when shared on social apps.

Optimize images and videos for fast loading (lazy loading).

Support adding analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics).

Additional Pages & Trust

Simple About Us page

Contact section with Telegram and WhatsApp buttons

Technical Notes

Fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Clean, modern UI.

Scalable structure for adding more products later.
